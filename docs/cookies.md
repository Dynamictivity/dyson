Cookies
=======

In the [Extra Modules](https://github.com/dynamictivity/dyson-modules-extras) 
repository, there exist some modules for you to deal with cookies.

## Add a Cookie

```yaml
---
- add_cookie:
    var1: something
    var2:
      subvar: something else
```

As you can see from the command above, we are able to specify any configuration
of cookie we want.
